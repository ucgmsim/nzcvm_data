# Tomography Models in NZCVM

The tomography models in the NZCVM provide the background velocity structure for New Zealand. These models are derived from seismic travel-time data and offer a lower-resolution (~10 km) representation of the subsurface velocity structure.

## Available Tomography Models

The NZCVM currently supports the following tomography models:


1. NZWide 2.2 : Based on Eberhart-Phillips et al. (2020).
- **2020_NZ**: Linear interpolation of NWide 2.2 model 
- **2020_NZ_OFFSHORE**: Extension of the 2020 model with a basin submodel and offshore tapering applied.
- **2020_NZ_OFFSHORE_NO_BASIN**: Extension of the 2020 model with the offshore region but no basin submodel applied.
2. NZWide 3.1 : Based on Eberhart-Phillips et al. (2025).

## Tomography Model Definition

Tomography models are defined in the `nzcvm_registry.yaml` file. Here's an example of a tomography model definition:

```yaml
tomography:
    - name: 2020_NZ_OFFSHORE
      nElev: 20
      elev: [ 15, 1, -3, -8, -15, -23, -30, -38, -48, -65, -85, -105, -130, -155, -185, -225, -275, -370, -620, -750 ]
      vs30_path: global/vs30/NZ_Vs30_HD_With_Offshore.h5
      special_offshore_tapering: true
      path: global/tomography/2020_NZ.h5
```

The key components of a tomography model definition are:

- **name**: Identifier for the tomography model.
- **nElev**: Number of elevation levels in the model.
- **elev**: Array of elevation values (in kilometers) for the model.
- **vs30_path**: Path to the Vs30 (shear wave velocity in the top 30 meters) data file. Needed for the Geotechnical Layer (GTL) model using a near-surface velocity adjustment (Ely 2010)
- **special_offshore_tapering**: Indicates whether to apply a 1D velocity model for offshore region with very soft sediments. 
- **path**: Path to the tomography model data file (in HDF5 format).


### What is special_offshore_tapering?
If `special_offshore_tapering` is true, a specialized velocity adjustment is triggered for offshore regions with very soft sediments. This ensures a *smooth transition* from land-based velocity models to offshore conditions

It is designed to provide a more accurate and consistent velocity profile in offshore areas, particularly in shallow waters where low-velocity sediments may not be captured accurately by the tomography model alone.

**How it Works**: When the flag is true, the code checks two conditions for each grid point:
1. The point is offshore, meaning its distance from the shoreline is greater than 0.
2. The Vs30 value at that point is very low (< 100 m/s), indicating very soft ground.
  
If both conditions are met, the code applies a pre-defined 1D velocity model for offshore region and a specialized basin depth calculation based on the distance from the shoreline. 
This creates a "smooth transition" from the land-based model to a more appropriate offshore model, preventing abrupt velocity changes.

## Usage in Model Versions

Tomography models are specified in the model version configuration files. For example, in `2p03.yaml`:

```yaml
tomography: 2010_NZ_OFFSHORE
```

This indicates that the 2p03 model version uses the `2010_NZ_OFFSHORE` tomography model.

## Tomography Submodels

Tomography submodels are used to compute velocity values at specific locations based on the tomography model data. These submodels are defined in the `nzcvm_registry.yaml` file and are associated with surfaces in the model version configuration.

```yaml
submodel:
    - name: ep_tomography_submod_v2010
      type: tomography
      module: ep_tomography_submod_v2010
```

This submodel is a type of `tomography`, and it retrieves more information associated with the `tomography` value from the registry (in this case, `2010_NZ_OFFSHORE`). The `module` specifies the name of the accompanying Python code that prescribes how to calculate velocity at locations within the region below the `surface`.

## Data Format

Tomography model data is stored in HDF5 format. For details on the structure and contents of these files, see the [Data Formats](DataFormats.md) page.
